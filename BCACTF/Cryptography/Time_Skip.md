# Hints
Ignore the silly science, but perhaps he wanted to mimic encryption methods of his new time.
# Solution
The parchment misleads you to a double transposition cipher which will make you make this very simple task difficult...

with the help of the Description, "long cylinder" it will lead you to a very old cipher called 'scytale cipher'
